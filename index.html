                <p>In truth, homelessness is a perpetual shame of humanity. It's a tragedy that there are people who own
                    so many houses they have to hire someone to keep track of it for them. And yet, some people have to
                    sleep on the sidewalk because they can't afford rent.</p>

            <p>Money is not the only commodity that is fun to give. We can give time, we can give our expertise, we can
                give our love, or simply give a smile. What does that cost? The point is, none of us can ever run out of
                something worthwhile to give.
                <br>
                <br>
                You give but little when you give of your possessions. It is when you give of yourself that you truly
                give.
